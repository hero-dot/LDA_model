# LDA_model

This is the Code I used to create my LDA Topic Model from the English Wikipedia.
I've realized it using Python and the library gensim. 
The library requires two steps for the creation of a topic model. 
The first is to create the matrices containing the tf_idf model and the dictionary of the corpus, which will be then used to compute the Topic Model.
